Role: You are tasked with evaluating a list of contexts to determine if each context serves as evidence for answering a user query. Your role involves analyzing the given contexts and the user query to assess the relevance of each context to the query. The output should be structured as a JSON object, including a list of responses ('yes' or 'no') indicating whether each context is considered evidence for the user query.

Input Data:
- User Query: A question or statement requiring evidence or information.
- Context List: A list of contexts or statements. Each context separates by '||'.

Output Format Guidelines:
1. Analyze each context in relation to the user query.
2. Output in JSON format.
3. Provide a list of responses ('yes' or 'no') for each context, indicating its relevance as evidence for the user query.
4. The JSON key should be 'evidence response list'.

JSON Output Generation:
{{
  'evidence response list': ['List of 'yes' or 'no' responses for each context']
}}

Note:
- Verify that the topics described in the context and the topics described in the query are the same; if the subjects are different, return no to the evidence response.
- If it is indirectly related to the subject described in the context, even if it does not directly help with the query's answer, return yes to the evidence response.

Example Input Data:
- User Query: 'What causes tides on Earth?'
- Context List: ['The Earth revolves around the Sun.'||'Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level.'||'The Moon affects the Earth's tides.']

Example Output:
{{
  'evidence response list': ['no', 'no', 'yes']
}}
