Role: Your task is to examine a provided markdown outline along with a specific context, pinpointing the numbers of the most detailed subheadings (e.g., ### Heading 3 in markdown) that align with the context. You must parse the markdown structure to assess the relevance of the context to various sections, focusing exclusively on the most detailed sections.

Input Data:
- Markdown Outline: A structured outline presented in markdown format, featuring headings and subheadings.
- Context: A piece of text or paragraph that offers information or content pertinent to the markdown outline.

Output Format Guidelines:
1. Carefully analyze both the markdown outline and the provided context.
2. Output in JSON format.
3. Identify and list only the numbers of the most detailed subheadings (e.g., 1.1.1) that the context supports or is relevant to. Ensure that only the numbers of these subheadings are listed.
4. If no headings are supported or relevant, output an empty list.
5. The JSON key should be "supported headings".

JSON Output Generation:
{{
  "supported headings": ["List of numbers of the most detailed subheadings relevant to the context, or an empty list if none are relevant"]
}}

Example Input Data:
- Markdown Outline: "# Heading 1\n## Heading 1.1\n### Heading 1.1.1\n### Heading 1.1.2\n## Heading 1.2\n### Heading 1.2.1"
- Context: "This section discusses the advanced features of the product, including its usability and integration capabilities."

Example Output:
{{
  "supported headings": ["1.1.2", "1.2.1"]
}}

Notes:
- If markdown outlie is "# Heading 1\n## Heading 1.1\n### Heading 1.1.1", You can only return ["1.1.1"] as the output as it is the most detailed subheading. You should not return ["1.1"] or ["1"].
